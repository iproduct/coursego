		Description:         "Understand the principles of software architecture with coverage on SOA, distributed and messaging systems, and database modeling Key Features Gain knowledge of architectural approaches on SOA and microservices for architectural decisions Explore different architectural patterns for building distributed applications Migrate applications written in Java or Python to the Go language Book Description Building software requires careful planning and architectural considerations; Golang was developed with a fresh perspective on building next-generation applications on the cloud with distributed and concurrent computing concerns. Hands-On Software Architecture with Golang starts with a brief introduction to architectural elements, Go, and a case study to demonstrate architectural principles. You'll then move on to look at code-level aspects such as modularity, class design, and constructs specific to Golang and implementation of design patterns. As you make your way through the chapters, you'll explore the core objectives of architecture such as effectively managing complexity, scalability, and reliability of software systems. You'll also work through creating distributed systems and their communication before moving on to modeling and scaling of data. In the concluding chapters, you'll learn to deploy architectures and plan the migration of applications from other languages. By the end of this book, you will have gained insight into various design and architectural patterns, which will enable you to create robust, scalable architecture using Golang. What you will learn Understand architectural paradigms and deep dive into Microservices Design parallelism/concurrency patterns and learn object-oriented design patterns in Go Explore API-driven systems architecture with introduction to REST and GraphQL standards Build event-driven architectures and make your architectures anti-fragile Engineer scalability and learn how to migrate to Go from other languages Get to grips with deployment considerations with CICD pipeline, cloud deployments, and so on Build an end-to-end e-commerce (travel) application backend in Go Who this book is for Hands-On Software Architecture with Golang is for software developers, architects, and CTOs looking to use Go in their software architecture to build enterprise-grade applications. Programming knowledge of Golang is assumed.",

		Description:         "Imagine that you like to learn a new programming language, and you start by leveraging what you already know and bridge the gap in learning specific parts of the new language. This book was created on that idea, it starts with using my existing language knowledge and experience to breakdown Go into familiar Ruby concepts and implementations. The first thing I did to learn Go professionally is to relate to what I know in Ruby. Iâ€™ve been a professional Ruby programmer since 2009 and in over a decade of professional experience working as a software engineer, I have worked on multiple programming languages. And proven personally that itâ€™s easier to learn a programming concept from something familiar to me. This helps me to learn the new language faster, which also means being productive much faster as well. This book was created on my first-hand experience of learning Go from my existing knowledge and experience in Ruby. The book was carefully thought from ground-up, collecting familiar patterns, abstracts, and analogs in Ruby, and relate it with a proper implementation in Go. By teaching familiar implementations found in Ruby, you will see the correlation between the two languages, establishing familiar concepts to give you enough knowledge to be comfortable with Go and to start programming with it. Go is an easy language to work with, itâ€™s modern, flexible, powerful and fast. It compiles to binary which gives it an ability for a binary distribution that runs on different platforms, and Go has almost in par performance with C, with package support, memory safety, automatic garbage collection and concurrency built-in. And you get all the nice features from a statically typed language, which IDEs can make use of, and so also improving your development workflow. Notable open-source projects are built using Go (i.e. Docker, Kubernetes, Etherium and Terraform to name a few), this gives you an advantage because those platforms have APIs and SDKs readily available in Go natively for you to use. And many global companies have been using Go in production (i.e. Google, Netflix, Dropbox, Heroku and Uber to name a few), proving that it has been battle-tested and powerful mature language to based your work into. Go is created by an interesting mixed of people. Google is the company that funded Goâ€™s development, and the authors of Go who designed the language are mainly Robert Griese- mer (worked on V8 Javascript Engine, Java HotSpot VM, and the Strongtalk system), Rob Pike (known for Plan 9 and UTF-8), and Ken Thompson (known for Unix, C programming language, Plan 9, UTF-8 and Inferno to name a few). This book will definitely help you get started with Go from your existing Ruby knowledge, and start to hit the ground fast, running!",

Learn how to utilize the powerful AWS services from within your application Book Description Awarded as one of the best books of all time by BookAuthority, Cloud Native Programming with Golang will take you on a journey into the world of microservices and cloud computing with the help of Go. Cloud computing and microservices are two very important concepts in modern software architecture. They represent key skills that ambitious software engineers need to acquire in order to design and build software applications capable of performing and scaling. Go is a modern cross-platform programming language that is very powerful yet simple; it is an excellent choice for microservices and cloud applications. Go is gaining more and more popularity, and becoming a very attractive skill. This book starts by covering the software architectural patterns of cloud applications, as well as practical concepts regarding how to scale, distribute, and deploy those applications. You will also learn how to build a JavaScript-based front-end for your application, using TypeScript and React. From there, we dive into commercial cloud offerings by covering AWS. Finally, we conclude our book by providing some overviews of other concepts and technologies that you can explore, to move from where the book leaves off. What you will learn Understand modern software applications architectures Build secure microservices that can effectively communicate with other services Get to know about event-driven architectures by diving into message queues such as Kafka, Rabbitmq, and AWS SQS. Understand key modern database technologies such as MongoDB, and Amazonâ€™s DynamoDB Leverage the power of containers Explore Amazon cloud services fundamentals Know how to utilize the power of the Go language to access key services in the Amazon cloud such as S3, SQS, DynamoDB and more.
